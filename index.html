                <p class="text-small">Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, 
                staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. 
                Rather, itâ€™s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, 
                and boosting your mood.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">regular exercise is good for you, 
            and it can help you lose weight. But if you are like many Americans,
             you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet changed 
             your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start.
              You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more physical activity into 
              your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended 
              amount of exercise for your age. If you can do it, the payoff is that you 
            will feel better, help prevent or control many diseases, and likely even live longer.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A healthy diet is one that helps maintain or improve overall
                health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients,
                micronutrients, and adequate calories.

                A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no
                processed food and sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from
                a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin B12
                is needed for those following a vegan diet.[3] Various nutrition guides are published by medical
                and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be
                healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers 
                to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The World Health Organization describes mental
                 health as "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her 
                 own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively
                  and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".
                  Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness.
